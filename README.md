Exploring two decades of flight delays in the USA of factors, failures, and predictive modeling

Introduction

This huge dataset consist flight arrival and departure data for significant carriers in the United States from 1987 to 
2008, however, we will concentrate for further analysis in the year 2004 and 2005. By narrowing down, we can
acquire a more focused understanding of flight patterns, delays, and other factors that might have an impact on
the airline sector during that time period by limiting the information to two years.
The examination of this dataset is crucial since flight delays and cancellations can have a major negative impact
on both airlines' bottom lines and their customers' quality of life. Furthermore, being aware of the causes of these
disruptions and cancellations might point out areas for improvement in air traffic control and airline operations.
Thus, it can assist in informing policy development and decision-making efforts targeted at lowering the incidence
and effects of flight delays and cancellations.

Conclusion

For question 1, In summary, before noon and then at night are the best times of day to fly and avoid delays.
The day of the week with the fewest flight delays is Saturday, followed by Tuesday and Wednesday. The
least amount of delays occur in September, then April, then autumn, which has the lowest average delay.
These results imply that fewer travellers and less traffic during these times and periods may result in lesser
waits.
For question 2, The data reveals that older planes had greater percentages of delayed flights and longer
average delays, but the difference is not large enough to draw the conclusion that older planes experience
more delays than newer ones. In addition to the age of the aircraft, other variables may potentially cause
delays.
For question 3, In order to monitor changes in the number of passengers flying between different places
over time and determine the busiest airport combinations, related airports, and flight frequency patterns,
the research looks at flight data from the previous six years. It also covers the top airlines that fly between
cities and looks into why there were decreased flights in February 2000. A list of the top 10 airport
connections and a map of flights connecting US cities from 2000 to 2005 are included in the results.
For question 4, Between the airports of LAS and LAX, the research finds cascading delay issues. The graph
illustrates the pattern of delays at the two airports and demonstrates how delays at one airport can impact
delays at the other. Cascading delays affected a total of 181 flights, or 16.5% of all flights on this route.
According to the analysis, delays at LAS may result in delays at LAX and vice versa, impacting over half of
all flights.
For question 5, In light of the data available, the Random Forest model outperforms the Linear Regression
model in forecasting flight delays. The Random Forest model is simpler to understand and apply in reality
because it predicts a binary outcome and has a greater accuracy (99.912%). The provided graphs
demonstrate that it is also a classification model, which is better suitable for this situation, and that it
performs well. As a result, it is recommended that the Random Forest model be used to forecast flight
delays.
